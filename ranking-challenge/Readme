Challenge: 

If I were given a data file with just 2 columns - Name and Rank. 
Name column has values which are repeated as well as Rank column. 
Challenge is to find the hightest rank for each Name value and create a new column repeating the highest rank for each specific name
as many times as it is encountered. 

To solve this I have used random functions from numpy module and dataframe functions from Pandas module. 

Note: There are two versions of jupyter notebooks. 1. ranking.ipynb uses an excel file as it's data source, whereas 
  2. ranking_pandas.ipynb creates data as part of the code.
